# PCA_on_IRIS_datset
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.

In this project the PCA is applied on IRIS dataset to obtain the 2 principal components which are linealy un correlated features. And these features cover most of the information in the original IRIS dataset. A detailed jupiter notebook is presented with the code to perform the PCA and analyze its output along with the required explanation.
